Realtime application of Actuators:-
    Imagine you have developed the service and it's ready to use. How will you make sure that your service is running?
    One way is to hit the endpoint that you have defined which usually will take some request and respond accordingly. right? 
    And if it throws an exception, you will know that service is down. Do you think this approach is right? 
    The actuator comes into the picture in such scenario -- for example if you want to check the health of the service - hit the /health endpoint, 
    if you want info about service, hit /info endpoint and similarly for others.

Actuator Endpoints
    Actuator endpoints let us monitor and interact with our application.
