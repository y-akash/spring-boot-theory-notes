Benefits of Spring Boot
        Dependecy Resoution
        Minimum configuration
        Embedded server for testing i.e. tomcat
        Bean auto scan
        Health metrics

@SpringBootApplication
        This annotation goes to the class which has main method and
        It tells the springboot that this is the starting point for our springboot application


SpringApplication.run(ClassName.class, args)
        we need to tell springboot to start the applictation and 
        then create a servlet container and host this apllication in that servlet container and make it avilable right.


**********
Controller will only work if it is the part of main class. 
Example : if main class is in 'package1' and controller is in 'package2', 
then it won't work.. so controller must be in 'package1.anyname'
**********


@RestController
        makes this class to serve as a rest endpoints. or
        If we assign to a class than it means that
        we can have methods in that class which map to URL requests


@RequestMapping        
        To map specific HTTP methods, 
        we have to specify in the annotation
        otherwise it will work for all the request methods
        ex-> @RequestMapping("/hi")
        @RequestMapping(value="/hi", method = RequestMethod.GET)


@Service
        it marks the class as Bussiness Service
        When the application starts up spring creates an instance of this Service class and
        then it keeps that in its memory and registers that instance
        we can have other classes and other services or other controllers which can
        depends on that service class than it declares a dependecy and say 
        hey spring I need that service class and then spring knows that this is an instance 
        that has created already and it's going to inject it to those different classes
        for that we used @Autowired in that class which need the service class
@Autowired


@Column(
	name = "First_Name",
	nullable = fale
)
private String firstName;

// if we write this @Column before any variable than we can provide custom name to that in the database
// so here its firstName in java but inside databae the column name will be "First_Name"
// and we can also provide constraints

#Common application properties on spring website
        we can get exact key to change the configuration in application.properties file
        ex-> if we want to run the server on port 8090 instead of 8080 than i can change it in a application.properties file
                server.port=8090
